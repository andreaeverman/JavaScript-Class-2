# Javascript Assignment #2

Understanding Javascript conditions and loops

## Assignment

1. Fork this repo.

1. Only code inside the file named `script.js`. No editing any other files.

1. Write a [`for`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/for) loop to add a click event listener on all divs with class `box`.

1. When the user clicks any box, change that box's background color to one of the following colors.

    - If number of boxes on the page is between **201 and 300**, inclusive, change the background color of the box to **'yellow'**.

    - If number of boxes on the page is between **301 and 400**, inclusive, change the background color of the box to **'green'**.

    - If number of boxes on the page is between **401 and 500**, inclusive, change the background color of the box to **'purple'**.

    - If number of boxes on the page is between **501 and 600**, inclusive, change the background color of the box to **'orange'**.

    - If number of boxes on the page is between **601 and 700**, inclusive, change the background color of the box to **'pink'**.

    - If number of boxes on the page is between **701 and 800**, inclusive, change the background color of the box to **'black'**.

    - If number of boxes on the page is between **801 and 900**, inclusive, change the background color of the box to **'brown'**.

    - Otherwise, change the background color of the box to **'blue'**.

## For extra credit

1. In the click event function, change that box's class to `clicked`. If it's already the class of `clicked`, change it back to `box`. Basically, if a box is clicked, it should toggle between the css class of `box` and `clicked`.
